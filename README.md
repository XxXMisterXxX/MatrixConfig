The optimized config for Matrix Anticheat.

And this GitHub repository is for tracking issues/feature requests + for other people to contribute.

The `checks-skywars.yml` file contains minor changes for my SkyWars server - you don't need it really.

## Warning!
The config here is most likely in development; it's better to download it in Matrix's discord server (config-share channel.)
