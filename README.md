# MatrixConfig
[![Built with oxygen](https://badgen.net/badge/built%20with/oxygen/green)](https://example.com/) [![For matrix](https://badgen.net/badge/for%20free%20matrix/4.7.10/green)](https://example.com/)

**Warning: The free version of Matrix isn't updated anymore - the last free version was 4.7.10. You should use `checks-free.yml` for the free version now.** Premium users will get the config for premium soon.

The optimized config for Matrix Anticheat.

And this GitHub repository is for tracking issues/feature requests + for other people to contribute. 

You can use this for anything, and modify it if you want to, but just please don't say that it's entirely yours and no one else contributed to it.

Also, remember that with Matrix, it's either get a big amount of false kicks or make the detection a little bit more lenient.

In other words, I can't make your anticheat kick people seconds after they turn on their hacks without causing false positives if I can't even access the code. This isn't as customizable as NoCheatPlus.

## Warning!
The config here is most likely in development; it's better to download it in Matrix's discord server (config-share channel.)

Also, don't assume that this config will be perfect for your server out of the box - each server is different, you should tweak the config for your own needs.
