The optimized config for Matrix Anticheat.

And this GitHub repository is for tracking issues/feature requests + for other people to contribute. 

The `checks-skywars.yml` file contains minor patches for my SkyWars server - you don't need it.

You can use this for anything, and modify it if you want to, but just please don't say that it's entirely yours and no one else contributed to it.

Also, remember that with Matrix, it's either get a big amount of false kicks or make the detection a little bit more lenient.

In other words, I can't make your anticheat kick people seconds after they turn on their hacks if I can't even access the code. This isn't as customizable as NoCheatPlus.

## Warning!
The config here is most likely in development; it's better to download it in Matrix's discord server (config-share channel.)
