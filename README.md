# MatrixConfig
[![Built with](https://badgen.net/badge/built%20with/oxygen/green)](https://example.com/)

The optimized config for Matrix Anticheat.
I don't want to add any clutter to the README.md file. It's just a config.
...and it has a github for people to contribute and report issues.

## Warning!
The config here is most likely in development or outdated - it's better to download it in Matrix's discord server (config-share channel.)
